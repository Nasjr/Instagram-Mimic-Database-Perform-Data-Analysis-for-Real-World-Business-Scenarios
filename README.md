# Instagram Mimic Database: Perform Data Analysis for Real World Business Scenarios
This project is a cloned mimic version of the Instagram database. It is used to perform data analysis for real world business 
related questions and scenarios such as finding out the rewarding system for the loyal users, launching campaigns to target the weekdays with the most user registrations, encouraging inactive users to log in back to the system, and more.


# ðŸ“– Usage

The Instagram Mimic Database contains different tables such as users, posts, likes, comments, and more. You can use SQL queries to perform data analysis on the tables and answer real world business questions and scenarios.

For example, to find out the rewarding system for the loyal users, you can use a SQL query to calculate the number of likes and comments that each user has received and rank them in descending order. You can then reward the top users with a prize or discount code.

To launch a campaign to target the weekdays with the most user registrations, you can use a SQL query to calculate the number of user registrations on each day of the week and identify the top days. You can then launch the campaign on those days to maximize the impact.

To encourage inactive users to log in back to the system, you can use a SQL query to identify the users who haven't logged in for a certain period and send them a personalized email or notification to remind them of the benefits of using the system.
